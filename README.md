### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven, a Gameplayer Programmer currently studying at Bradley University with a major in Game Design and minor in Computer Science. Most of my games are made with Unity, but I've been working on learing more languages and engines.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my senior capstone game, [Normal Pizza for Normal People](https://github.com/NightAngel47/Normal-Pizza-for-Normal-People), and [Nebula](https://github.com/NightAngel47/Nebula)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about game engine development ([Game Engine](https://github.com/NightAngel47/Game-Engine)) and C++
- You can checkout my [Portfolio](https://stevendrovie.com)
